In this project, I created a four components using react-jsx, Heading, Form, Navigation & Card components.

The Heading, Navigation and Card components are rendered directly in App.js but the form component is injected in the Navigation component.

I initially created three seperate cards in the card component as instructed in the checkpoint. But with the need to explore around the react-props, i deleted 2 components and used destructured props to pass data to the cards. 
Hence, the card components was rendered three times in App.js and embedded in a div for styling purpose.

the boostrap styles that are effected in this project components is only imported once in App.js but the react-bootstrap was relatively imported in the respective components.

A single CSS file for styling jsx components is created for ease and maintainability.
